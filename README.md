# Deep Learning Methods for AT-TPC Event Classification

This repository contains research code that explores the use of deep learning methods to classify AT-TPC events
based on the product of the reaction. This work was done using data from Argon 46 experiments.

See [Machine Learning Methods for Track Classification in the AT-TPC][1].

* `click`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `tensorflow`
